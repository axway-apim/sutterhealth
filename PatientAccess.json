A document is some sequence of bytes that is identifiable, establishes its own context (e.g., what subject, author, etc. can be displayed to the user), and has defined update management. The DocumentReference resource can be used with any document format that has a recognized mime type and that conforms to this definition.\n\nThe `US-Core-DocumentReference` FHIR [Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/index.html) contains complete details.  \n\nReference the FHIR specification for detailed `US-Core-DocumentReference` [attribute descriptions](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference-definitions.html) and [sample response](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/DocumentReference-episode-summary.json.html#).\n\n**Warning:**\nAttribute `__id` with value `giztmotwmvzhg2lpnyxtclrshjygc5djmvxhillbmnzs44dsnfzw2ltznvwa` is ***required*** for prototyping only.",
